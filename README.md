### Project Overview
- Advertising is a marketing tool used to promote products or services, typically funded by sponsors and delivered through online and offline channels. Android, Google's mobile operating system, dominates 69% of the global market, with the Google Play Store as its main app distribution platform.
- Zoom Ads, an advertising agency, seeks to analyze Google Play Store data to identify app trends and optimize ad placements for maximum profit. As a Data Scientist, your task is to analyze detailed app information to provide insights on features and the current state of the Android app market. The dataset includes over 4,000 apps across various categories, with attributes like ratings and reviews.
